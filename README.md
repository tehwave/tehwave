# Hi, I'm tehwave 👋

I'm a developer, educator, and community organizer passionate about game and web development.

## 🎮 Organizer of [gm(48)](https://gm48.net) game jam 

The gm(48) is a quarterly community event centered around a competition, in which indie game developers, by themselves solo or in teams, must develop a game in GameMaker Studio 2 in 48 hours.

These competitions are commonly referred to as game jams. Once the games have been submitted, everyone will play, rate and critique the submissions for two weeks, the ratings from which the top three games will receive licenses to GameMaker Studio 2 as prizes.

The game jam is open for free to developers of all ages, abilities and backgrounds. Beginner or expert, young or old, artist or programmer, all are welcome in the gm(48) game jam community.

Beyond organizing the competition, I also design, develop, and manage the [gm(48) website](https://gm48.net), including the custom submission process and game jam infrastructure.

## 👨‍🏫 Game Dev Teacher

I've professionally taught game development to kids and beginners, sharing my love for creativity and creation.  

## 💻 Web Developer

I work professionally with:

- **Laravel** & **PHP** – robust web apps
- **WordPress** – custom themes, plugins, and scalable sites

I love combining my interests, so most of my projects involve games and their development, web development, and their communities.
